## Consideration: Iso - Area vs Buffer

A buffer area is the most common way to delineate a catchment area. It measures a Euclidean distance away from the point given. However, this convenience comes with some issue. Using Euclidean distances is essentially a straight line and can be misleading and impractical on a map.

A more credible and realistic approach to delineate the catchment area would be to use network distance i.e., the shortest distance approach. The method that provides this approach is Iso-Areas as Polygons (from Layer). The iso areas are mapped onto the walkable paths by Singaporeans making it more accurate.

In reality, a person cannot always travel in a straight line towards their destination but will have to turn at bends and curves depending on their walking paths.

# **1.0: Data Collection**

## **1.1 Downloading geospatial data**

First, download the following geospatial data from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/):

-   Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)

-   Rail stations

Next, download geospatial data from [geofabrick](https://download.geofabrik.de/):

-   Roads and Buildings data from OpenStreetMap(OSM) data sets

# **2.0 Data Preparation and Data Cleaning : OSM**

## **2.1 Preparation of Road Network Layer**

We imported the Road Network data(gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp) into QGIS. The Road Network data contains the Road network from Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore.

### **2.1.1 Selecting all road network within the study area**

Using the **Select Features by Polygon** operation of QGIS, we then extracted the road network features that fall within Singapore study area.

### **2.1.2 Extracting roads except expressways**

Under the Layers panel, right click on **roads** --\> **Open Attribute Table**.

Click on **Select features using an expression** icon. The **Select by Expression** dialog window will appear. Under the expression pane, we keyed in the following to select expressways in Singapore:

> **"fclass"= 'motorway or "fclass"= 'motorway_link**

In the attribute table, we then clicked on **Invert Selection** so that all the roads except expressways are selected. The selection was then saved.

## **2.2 Preparation of Buildings Layer**

Import the Building Network data(gis_osm_buildings_free_1.shp) into QGIS. The building Network data contains the building network from Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore.

### 2.2.1 Selecting all buildings within the study area

Using the **Clip** operation of QGIS, extract the building network features that fall with Singapore study area.

For the Input **layer**, we selected the input layer to clip i.e. gis_osm_roads_buildings_1.shp

For the Overlay **layer**, we selected the layer that will be used as reference i.e. SG_Subzone

After clipping, we saved the new clip as **Buildings**.

### 2.2.2 **Categorising buildings within the iso areas**

Upon inspecting the attribute table of the **buildings** layer, we found that some of the buildings were not categorised properly i.e. Null values.

![](images/AT1.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Thus, we used Google street View as a reference and re-categorised these buildings.

#### **2.2.2.1 Creating a new field called class for the buildings within the iso area**

From the attribute table, we clicked on the **toggle editing mode** to create a **New field**

-   For **Name**, type 'class'

-   For **Type**, select Text (string)

-   For **Length**, select 30

-   Click **OK**

#### 2.2.2.2 Identifying buildings within the iso-areas

Import **OpenStreetMap** layer into QGIS.

Using Google Street view as a reference, we can compare and determine what class each building should be.

#### 2.2.2.3 Categorising the buildings within the Iso Area

Select the buildings to be classed and open the attribute table. Select the **Open field calculator** symbol and check **Update existing field** Click on the dropdown arrow and select **class**, then in the Expression Pane, type the correct class. The classifications we have decided on are:

-   Private Residential

-   Business

-   Civic

-   Education

-   Others

-   Public Residential

-   Religious

This will update all selected features to the correct class.

#### 2.2.2.4 Symbolising Buildings

a)   Right click on **FM_buildings** Layer.

b)   Click on **Properties**

c)    Go to the **Symbology** tab

d)   Select **Categorized**

e)   For **value**, select **class**

f)     Click on **Apply**

g)   Click on the dropdown arrow of Symbol and change the colour schemes, assign the values of the class to the following colours below

![](images/Colours.jpg)

h)   Click on **Apply** again then click on **OK**

Repeat the steps on the remaining buildings that falls within the other iso areas.

## **2.3 Preparation of Rail Stations**

Import Rail Stations data(master-plan-2019-rail-station-layer) into QGIS. The rail stations data contains the all the MRT station in Singapore.

### 2.3.1 Extracting TEL Stage 4 stations

Under the Layers panel, right click on **G_MP19_RAIL_STN_PL** --\> **Open Attribute Table**.

Click on **Select features using an expression** and key in the following query statement:

> **"Name"  =  'FOUNDERS'' MEMORIAL' or  "Name"  =  'TANJONG RHU' or  "Name"  =  'KATONG PARK' or  "Name"  =  'TANJONG KATONG' or  "Name"  =  'MARINE PARADE' or  "Name"  =  'MARINE TERRACE' or  "Name"  =  'SIGLAP' or  "Name"  =  'BAYSHORE'**

Click on **Select Features** and then **close** the window. Save the selected features as **TEL4_stations**.

### 2.3.2 Adding Entrances/Exits to the TEL stage 4 stations

#### 2.3.2.1 Creating a new entrance/exit layer

We need to create a point layer for MRT station entrances in order to have an end point for network creation later.

a\) Go to **Layer --\> Create Layer --\>New Shapefile Layer**

b\) For file name, navigate to the Geopackage folder and name the layer MRT Station Entrance Stage 4.

c\) For Geometry type, select **Point** from the dropdown arrow.

d\) Change the CRS projection system back to **EPSG 3412.**

Two new fields should be added, STN_N and EXIT_N.

a\) To add a new field, type **STN_N.**

b\) For Type, select **text**

c\) Click on **Add to Fields List**

A new row will be added.

Using the same steps, add a new row where Name= **EXIT_N** and Type= **integer**

Click on **OK**

#### 2.3.2.2 Adding points to TEL Stage 4 MRT stations

a\) Click on the toggle editing mode

b\) Click on the Add Point Feature

c\) Using the station picture in Figure 1 of Founders' Memorial in [LTA website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html) as a reference, manually click on the Founders memorial polygon to add the points.

d)   A dialog window will appear.

e)   For **id**, type **1**. For **STN_N**, type **FOUNDERS' MEMORIAL**. For **EXIT_N** , type **1**.

f)     For the second exit, for id, type 2. For **STN_N**, type **FOUNDERS' MEMORIAL.** For **EXIT_N** , type **2**.

g)   Click on the toggle editing mode.

d)    Click **save**.

Repeat the same steps for the entrances/exits of the other MRT stations. Use the TEL stage 4 entrance/exits in the [LTA website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html) as a reference.

Note: The id is the nth MRT entrances/exits of all where n\>0. The EXIT_N represents the kth entrance/exit of that MRT station where K\>0.

We saved the layer in Geopackage format. Call the layer **MRT Station Entrance Stage 4**.

## 2.4 Preparation of ISO-AREAS of 800m with contour lines of 200m

Now we will be implementing **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)** as a way to delineate the catchment areas to derive the accessibility to the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations

### 2.4.1 Creating ISO AREAS

Select the entrance/exit points of a single MRT station (eg. FOUNDERS' MEMORIAL)

-   In the menu bar, go to **Processing** --\> **toolbox**.

-   In toolbox, click on the dropdown arrow beside **QNEAT3**

-   Click on the dropdown arrow beside **Iso-Areas**.

-   Double click on **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)**

-   The dialog window for **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)** will appear

    -   For **Vector layer representing network**, select *roads except motorway* from the drop-down list.

    -   For **Start Points**, select *MRT Station Entrance Stage 4* from the drop-down list

    -   For **Unique Point ID field**, leave it as fid

    -   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type *800*.

    -   For **Contour Interval**, type *200*

    -   Keep the rest of the entries as default.

When you are ready to run the function, click on **run**

When the process completed, two temporary layers namely: `Output Polygon` and `Output Interpolation` will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window. Save the layer as **{Station initials}\_ISO**.

### 2.4.2 Changing the interval size of the iso-areas

a\) Right click on **FM_ISO** Layer.

b\) Click on **Properties**

c\) Go to the **Symbology** tab

d\) Select **Graduated**

e\) For **value**, select **cost_level**

f\) Change the colour ramp to a suitable colour range and check **Invert colour ramp**

g\) For **mode** select **Fixed Interval**

h\) Change the **interval size** to **199**. This is to ensure each band shows up in the gradient

i\) Once ready, click on **Apply** then **OK**

Click on **Save** then click on the **Deselect Features from All Layers**

Repeat the steps to create the iso areas for the remaining entrances/exits of the other MRT stations and change the intervals.

## **2.5 Extracting buildings within the iso areas**

Do not use clipped as the buildings may get 'chopped' off

From the menu bar, select the **Select by Location**

-   *For Select features from*, select TEL- buildings from the dropdown arrow

-   Check the *intersect* box

-   For *By comparing to the features from*, select FM_ISO from the dropdown arrow

After running it, save the layer as **{Station initials}\_buildings**.

Repeat the process for all stations.
